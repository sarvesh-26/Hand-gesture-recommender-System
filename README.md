Import Necessary Packages: The code imports essential libraries such as OpenCV (cv2), NumPy (numpy), TensorFlow (tensorflow), and MediaPipe (mediapipe). TensorFlow's Keras API is also imported for loading the pre-trained gesture recognition model.

Initialize MediaPipe: The script initializes the MediaPipe library for hand detection and landmark estimation. It sets up the hands module with parameters such as the maximum number of hands to detect and the minimum detection confidence.

Load Gesture Recognition Model: A pre-trained gesture recognition model is loaded using TensorFlow's load_model function from the Keras API. The model is responsible for predicting the gesture based on hand landmarks.

Initialize Webcam: The script initializes the webcam using OpenCV's VideoCapture function. It opens the default webcam (index 0) for capturing video frames.

Real-time Gesture Detection Loop: Inside a while loop, the script continuously reads frames from the webcam. Each frame is processed to detect hand landmarks using MediaPipe. Once landmarks are obtained, they are used as input to the gesture recognition model to predict the corresponding gesture.

Display Prediction: The predicted gesture class name is overlaid on the video frame using OpenCV's putText function. The frame with the prediction is then displayed in a window named "Output".

Exit Condition: The script listens for the 'q' key press to break out of the loop and exit the program.

Release Resources: After exiting the loop, the script releases the webcam and closes all active OpenCV windows.

Overall, this script provides a real-time demonstration of hand gesture recognition using a webcam, showcasing the capabilities of computer vision and machine learning in interpreting h
uman gestures.

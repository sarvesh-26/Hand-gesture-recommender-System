# Hand-gesture-recommender-system
 a machine learning-based approach that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize and recommend hand gestures for communication purposes. The system captures hand gestures using a camera, processes the captured data, and recommends the most suitable gesture based on the context and user preferences.
